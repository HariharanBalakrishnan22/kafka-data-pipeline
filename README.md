# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka and Docker

## Project Overview
This project sets up a real-time data pipeline using Kafka and Docker. The pipeline ingests streaming data, processes it, and stores the processed data in a new Kafka topic.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <repo-directory>`
4. Start the services: `docker-compose up`

## How to Run the Application
1. Start the Docker containers: `docker-compose up`
2. Run the Kafka consumer: `python kafka_consumer.py`

## Design Choices
- **Kafka**: Chosen for its high throughput, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- **Docker**: Simplifies the setup and ensures consistent environments.
- **Python**: Easy to write and maintain Kafka consumers/producers.

## Production Deployment
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration, scaling, and management.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and alerting.
- **ELK Stack**: For centralized logging.
- **Confluent Schema Registry**: For managing data schemas.

## Scaling Considerations
- **Partitioning**: Ensures data distribution across brokers.
- **Consumer Groups**: Allows scaling out consumers.
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes for dynamic scaling.
- **Optimized Configurations**: Tuning Kafka for high performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates setting up a real-time data pipeline with Kafka and Docker, showcasing skills in data streaming, containerization, and pipeline architecture.
